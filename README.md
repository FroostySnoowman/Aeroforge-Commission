# Aeroforge Locked Channels Commission

## Setting Up The Bot
First, go to https://discord.com/developers/applications and create a "New Application". Name it whatever you want and agree to the Terms of Service.

From here, go to "Bot" and "Reset Token". Put that token in the "TOKEN" section of the config.yml file.

Next, scroll down until you find "Privileged Gateway Intents" and select all 3 (PRESENCE INTENT, SERVER MEMBERS INTENT, and MESSAGE CONTENT INTENT).

Lastly, go to "OAuth2", click on "URL Generator" and choose "bot" and "application.commands". You can now specify what permission you want the bot to have, I strongly recommend Administrator permissions since this bot does NOT check for permissions. You can now copy the URL, put it in the browser, and invite the bot to the server(s) of your choosing.

## Config
Simply rename the "example_config.yml" file to "config.yml" and fill it out.

## Error Codes
    - 1: This error code means that the bot doesn't have the necessary permissions to add/remove someone from the channel.
